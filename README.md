Technological platforms labaratories

Labaratory 1: Students during laboratory classes familiarize themselves with basic operations on data collections as well as mechanisms for comparing and sorting objects.

Labaratory 2: Students during laboratory classes familiarize themselves with basic mechanisms of starting and synchronizing threads.

Laboratory 3: Students during laboratory classes familiarize themselves with the basic mechanisms of handling input-output as well as network communication using sockets.

Laboratory 4: Students during laboratory classes familiarize themselves with the basic mechanisms of mapping objects to tables in a database using the Java Persistence API.

Laboratory 5: Students during laboratory classes familiarize themselves with the basic mechanisms of writing unit tests using the JUnit and Mockito libraries.

Labaratory 6: Students during laboratory classes familiarize themselves with the basic mechanisms of parallelizing operations on streams using the Stream API. You should implement an application that processes a set of images using a stream pipeline. The application should accept the location of the directory containing the images and the location where the processed images will be saved as command-line arguments.
